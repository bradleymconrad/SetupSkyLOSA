SetupSkyLOSA: A MATLAB Tool to support Acquisition of Sky-LOSA Data
###################################################################

.. abstract-start

*SetupSkyLOSA* is a MATLAB-based software tool to support an end-user in the acquisition of sky-LOSA image data used to quantify soot/black carbon emissions from gas flares.

The accompanying submission to the `Journal of Atmospheric Measurement Techniques <https://www.atmospheric-measurement-techniques.net/index.html>`_ includes the theoretical background for *SetupSkyLOSA* and how to interpret results. The *SetupSkyLOSA* software provides guidance on the positioning and pointing of sky-LOSA camera based on statistics computed in a Monte Carlo-based General Uncertainty Analysis (GUA). The user provides the time and date, location (latitude and longitude), skylight conditions, and plume transmittance. *SetupSkyLOSA* parses these inputs and returns statistics in sky-LOSA-computed soot mass column density, which dominates sky-LOSA measurement uncertainty. The user can then interact with GUA data to determine the optimal camera pointing(s) given a desired threshold in uncertainty.
